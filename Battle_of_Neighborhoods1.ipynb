In any major city, with high population and high diversity, competition among restaurants are extremely high. Anyone entering the NYC restaurant landscape will need to conduct thorough analysis to determine the optimal location and area to open and thrive. Additionally, thorough analysis of the business environments and consumer preferences, segmented by area, will serve this new business venture well."
